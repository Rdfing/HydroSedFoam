This case study tests the hydrodynamic model in HydroSedFoam. A constant discharge was run through a laboratory flume having a fixed boundary and a sine-generated meandering planform, located at the University of Illinois Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory. Water surface elevations and flow velocities were measured in the flume and compared with the results obtained with the numerical simulation.

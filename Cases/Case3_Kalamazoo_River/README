In this case study, HydroSedFoam was applied to a section of the Kalamazoo River, located downstream of the City of Battle Creek, Michigan. The river section is 1.2km long, has an average bankfull channel width of 50m, and includes a partially disconnected oxbow lake and a bifurcate meander bend. Unstructured triangular grids were generated using GAMBIT. Each triangular grid cell was 5m in size and in total the computation domain included 9609 grid cells.

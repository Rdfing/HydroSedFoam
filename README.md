**Abstract**: Depth-averaged two-dimensional (2D) models are useful tools for understanding river morphodynamics through the computation of hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and an evolving river bed morphology. This paper presents a new parallelized 2D hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and bed morphology model, HydroSedFoam. The model uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for code parallelization and adopts a depth-averaged k-epsilon turbulence model. Three different case studies, including a laboratory experiment, an analytical solution, and a field-scale river reach, show good agreement with HydroSedFoam simulations. Further development and modification of the model are relatively straightforward to accomplish within the OpenFOAM framework.
